it cointains the title,what time it starts ,tickets sold and how long it takes.
it needs the following files index.html,
                                style.css
                                    script.js
                                     db.json
i fetched data from a local host to json
lets get down to building the program.


## index.html
as a web developer html is the building block of every web  without it a website cannot be created.
in the text editor create a file index.html
these are its elements.
     
     ```
        !Doctypehtml
        <html
        <head>
            <title/>
            <link rel=stylesheet href.style.css>
        />
        <body>
        />
        />
every tag should have a closing tag

## style.css

css describes how elements should be displayed in the bwoser they make them more eyecatching like colour ,fontsize,spaces and so more
linking it to html we put the link inside the html head tag as shown above 

## script.js
this file is where all execution takes place 
placing an event listener.
the event listener allows the user to communicate it with website like clicking on movie it will know 
'oh they have selected this movie'
fetching data.
fetching data is more of getting that data the films now to retriving the data from local host now to json and chaging it again to my data
Dom manipulation.


## db.json
this the file i copied the data from local host.
